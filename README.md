# Serpulo-Unit-Rebalance
Experimental modifications to the units in Mindustry with an eye toward improving balance.

**Current changes:**

Nova-Pulsar "Swap":

Nova
- Increased boost multiplier from 1.5 to 2.0
- Increased health from 120 to 320
- Reduced range from 19 to 7
- Replaced weapon with the Pulsar's original weapon

Pulsar
- Increased boost multiplier from 1.6 to 2.0
- Reduced speed from 0.7 to 0.55
- Reduced health from 320 to 240
- Reduced armor from 4 to 1
- Increased range from 7 to 26
- Replaced weapon with the Nova's original weapon, modified to shoot two projectiles per shot

Reasoning:
This makes more variety of tactics available within a tier of ground units. The Nova and Dagger roles are somewhat redundant, both doing roughly the same thing, but with the Nova being an upgraded version. Same for T2, the Pulsar and Mace essentially fill the same roles, one trading in some dps and tankiness for an ability, boost, and speed. By essentially swapping the Nova and Pulsar, it makes the decision between Nova vs Daggaer and Mace vs Pulsar more meaningful. The range increase on the Pulsar to 26 instead of 19 was to differentiate even more, essentially making it an artillery option at T2, outranging everything except Hails at that level.
